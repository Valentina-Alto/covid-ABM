# covid-ABM
Agent-Based Model to simulate covid-19 spread depending on individual risk perception.

# Abstract and main purpose

The goal of this project is modelling different scenarios and interventions to see to what extent individuals’ risk perception is affected, leading to a different set of behaviours with respect to COVID-19 preventions.
The idea is that if we were able to identify those latent factors which are more capable of driving human’s behaviours, we might be able to nudge individuals to behave more respectfully and carefully without imposing any legal restrictions.
